# bug_tracking_system
This is a bug tracking system I wrote when I was first learning PHP, JavaScript, and Jquery seriously.  It also uses some bootstrap, CSS, and of course good old fashion HTML.  I was using a mySQL database, but I didn't have enough foresight to export the database schema.  (DOH!)
